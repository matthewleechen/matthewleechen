#### Hello!

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Harvard University, and an affiliate at the Center for History and Economics.

My current research focuses on topics in economic development and growth, economic history, and labor economics. I'm particularly interested in economic and social networks, the history of science and innovation, and measuring the transmission of ideas across time.

My CV is available [here](https://matthewleechen.github.io/cv/MLC_CV_20_August_2023.pdf).

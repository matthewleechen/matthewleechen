#### Hello!

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Harvard University, and an affiliate at the Center for History and Economics.

My current research focuses on economic history, economic development, and labor economics. I'm particularly interested in the history of science and innovation, social and political aspects of trade and globalization, and measuring the transmission of ideas across time.

My CV is available [here](https://matthewleechen.github.io/cv/MLC_CV_31_Aug_2023.pdf).

#### Hello!

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Harvard University, and an affiliate at the Center for History and Economics.

My research examines science, innovation, trade, and the exchange of ideas in historical perspective, focusing on the British and Dutch contexts.

My CV is available [here](https://matthewleechen.github.io/cv/MLC_CV_17_Oct_2023.pdf).

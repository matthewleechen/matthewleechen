#### Hello!

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Harvard University, and an affiliate at the Center for History and Economics. I'm broadly interested in economic development, economic history, labor economics & political economy. I also have auxiliary interests in Dutch and Indonesian history, and in the digitization and linking of historical records.

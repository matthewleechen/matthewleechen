#### Hello!

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Harvard University, and an affiliate at the Center for History and Economics.

Interested in economic development, economic history, and labor economics. I have auxiliary interests in Dutch and Indonesian history, and in the digitization and linking of historical records.
